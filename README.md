# DELI-cious Sandwiches Application

The DELI-cious Sandwiches Application is a custom sandwich shop's solution for automating their order process.
This application aims to make online ordering easier for the deli shop.


## Application Overview

The DELI-cious Sandwiches Application is a simple application designed for a custom sandwich shop. It automates the ordering process and provides a convenient way for customers to place their sandwich orders online.

Customers can choose the size of their sandwich (4", 8", or 12") and select from different bread types (white, wheat, rye, or wrap). They can customize their sandwich by adding regular toppings like lettuce, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and more, as well as other toppings such as meats and cheeses (e.g., steak, ham, cheddar, swiss). Extra toppings come at an additional cost.

Additionally, customers can specify if they want their sandwich toasted and add drinks and chips to their order. Once the order is completed, the application displays the order details, including the list of sandwiches with toppings and the total cost. The order details are saved as a receipt file with a timestamp in the receipts folder.

### One interesting of piece code from the project :
        // public static final String TEXT_PURPLE = "\u001B[35m";
This code is interesting as it significantly enhances the appearance of our project by changing the color of the code to purple
