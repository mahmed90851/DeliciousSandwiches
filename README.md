# DELI-cious Point of Sales Application

The DELI-cious Point of Sales Application is a custom sandwich shop's solution for automating their order process.
DELI-cious currently manages orders manually on paper, but this application aims to streamline the process and make it available online in the future.


## Application Overview

The DELI-cious Point of Sales Application is a simple solution designed for a custom sandwich shop. It automates the order process and provides a convenient way for customers to place their sandwich orders.

Customers can choose the size of their sandwich (4", 8", or 12") and select from different bread types (white, wheat, rye, or wrap). They can customize their sandwich by adding regular toppings like lettuce, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and more, as well as premium toppings such as meats and cheeses (e.g., steak, ham, cheddar, swiss). Extra toppings come at an additional cost.

Additionally, customers can specify if they want their sandwich toasted and add drinks and chips to their order. Once the order is completed, the application displays the order details, including the list of sandwiches with toppings and the total cost. The order details are saved as a receipt file with a timestamp in the receipts folder.

The application aims to improve efficiency and enhance the customer experience at DELI-cious by automating the order process and ensuring accurate customization of sandwiches.
